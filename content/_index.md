## Mission Statement

UTS Furs is a social club for anyone with interest in anthropomorphism! Come join a diverse community of creative and unique individuals, and find somewhere to express yourself, find some new, more interesting friends and be yourself!

UTS Furs aims to foster a spirit of collaborative creativity, and bringing together artists, modellers, crafters, costumers, musicians, authors, and more. The furry community is built upon a love and respect for creative works and remains one of the most passionate and ardent supporters of their fellow creatives.

If you’re looking for a social space where you can really connect with some likeminded friends, then join us in our project. We’re somewhere you can drop the charade and stop worrying about judgement and vitriol from people who refuse to understand who you really are. We are an openly neurodiverse and queer-welcoming group (but everybody is welcome, regardless of how you identify!)

We’re also a good way to get involved in the local scene as a whole! If you’re interested in meeting more Sydney-based furs but don’t know where to start, or you need a friend to help you feel confident at events, our friendly community at UTS Furs will be a great entry point!

Come join us for our various events! We’re planning on hosting regular meets, including a UTS meet just before an external coffee event, so you can join in with your UTSFurs friends! We’re also looking at gaming nights, dinner meets, trivia, karaoke and bowling!
If you’re interested in making fursuits, cosplays or accessories, we’re planning on hosting crafting workshops, focused on the materials, techniques, and approaches to designing fursuits! Learn how to turn a concept or an idea into a fully realised, wearable 3D costume!

We welcome everyone who is open minded and interested in this community. Don’t worry if you don’t consider yourself a furry, or you don’t have a sona, it’s not important! We’re just aiming to be somewhere welcoming for anyone who doesn’t feel like they fit the norms, so if that’s you, come check us out!
